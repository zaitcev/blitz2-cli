The blitz2-cli is a couple of primitive shell scripts that implement
the blitz2 protocol. The blitz2u uploads your X11 clipboard to the server,
and the blitz2d downloads it.

Current implementation only works with a private HTTP server. Amazon S3,
Rackspace CF, and other such data stores are not supported at this time.

Installation
------------

Copy blitz2u and blitz2d to ~/bin/ or /usr/local/bin, blitz2.conf to
~/.config/blitz2/. Edit to suit.

Remember that this utility relies on so-called "HTTP Basic" authentication,
which must be protected with TLS on the open Internet.

Configuring Apache
------------------

Basically you want a webserver that allows uploads to a specified URL
with so-called "HTTP Basic" authentication.

First, create a protected directory and a password:

 [root@takane conf]# ls -la /var/www/html/protected/
 total 12
 drwxr-xr-x 2 apache root   4096 Sep 13 19:18 .
 drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Sep  3 08:58 ..
 -rw-r--r-- 1 apache apache    4 Sep 13 19:18 test1
 [root@takane conf]# cat /etc/htpasswd 
 blitzer:$apr1$EPQVDeJm$/znC/u1rXPy4sfv0lN0i41
 [root@takane conf]# 

Second, edit http.conf and add the following:

 # Add a protected directory (used by blitz2)
 <Directory "/var/www/html/protected">
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "Authentication Required"
   AuthUserFile "/etc/htpasswd"
   Require valid-user

   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all

   Dav On
 </Directory>
